# üìÅ MyDrive

A powerful, elegant, and user-focused file storage application built from scratch using **Next.js**, **Clerk**, **Neon**, **Drizzle**, and **ImageKit**.  
Inspired by cloud storage platforms, but designed to solve real-world pain points with a modern and developer-friendly stack.

## ‚ú® Why I am building MyDrive

While using popular cloud storage tools, I noticed two major gaps:



> While platforms like Google Drive and Dropbox are popular, they fail to address some critical UX and backend limitations.  
> MyDrive focuses on solving **real-world user pain points** with clear **technical innovations**.

---

### 1. üßπ **No Real Control Over Deleted or Trashed Files**

**Problem:** Mainstream drives keep trashed files indefinitely unless manually deleted, leading to clutter and storage overuse.

**MyDrive Fix:**  
- Introduced **auto-deletion logic** (customizable N-day expiration).
- Optional **pre-deletion alerts** and cleanup notifications.

**Tech Stack:**  
- PostgreSQL + CRON jobs + Drizzle ORM  
- Scheduled cleanup using timestamps and server background tasks.

---

### 2. üöÄ **Slow or Unreliable File Previews**

**Problem:** Large file previews are delayed, unsupported, or limited in default drives.

**MyDrive Fix:**  
- **Instant previews and thumbnails** using ImageKit‚Äôs real-time transformation.
- Better UX on slow networks or mobile devices.

**Tech Stack:**  
- ImageKit CDN  
- Preview generation handled via dynamic query parameters.

---

### 3. üîç **Inflexible Search & Poor File Organization**

**Problem:** Limited control over how files are organized or searched in platforms like Drive.

**MyDrive Fix:**  
- Support for **custom file tags** (`work`, `notes`, `urgent`).
- **Advanced search filters** (by tags, type, starred status, dates).

**Tech Stack:**  
- PostgreSQL full-text search + Drizzle  
- Tag schema & file metadata indexing
