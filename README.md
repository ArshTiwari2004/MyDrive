## ‚ú® Why I am building MyDrive

While using popular cloud storage tools, I noticed two major gaps:

> While platforms like Google Drive and Dropbox are popular, they fail to address some critical UX and backend limitations.  
> MyDrive focuses on solving **real-world user pain points** with clear **technical innovations**.

---

### 1. üßπ **No Real Control Over Deleted or Trashed Files**

**Problem:** Mainstream drives keep trashed files indefinitely unless manually deleted, leading to clutter and storage overuse.

**MyDrive Fix:**  
- Introduced **auto-deletion logic** (customizable N-day expiration).
- Optional **pre-deletion alerts** and cleanup notifications.

**Tech Stack:**  
- PostgreSQL + CRON jobs + Drizzle ORM  
- Scheduled cleanup using timestamps and server background tasks.

---

### 2. üöÄ **Slow or Unreliable File Previews**

**Problem:** Large file previews are delayed, unsupported, or limited in default drives.

**MyDrive Fix:**  
- **Instant previews and thumbnails** using ImageKit‚Äôs real-time transformation.
- Better UX on slow networks or mobile devices.

**Tech Stack:**  
- ImageKit CDN  
- Preview generation handled via dynamic query parameters.

---

### 3. üîç **Inflexible Search & Poor File Organization**

**Problem:** Limited control over how files are organized or searched in platforms like Drive.

**MyDrive Fix:**  
- Support for **custom file tags** (`work`, `notes`, `urgent`).
- **Advanced search filters** (by tags, type, starred status, dates).

**Tech Stack:**  
- PostgreSQL full-text search + Drizzle  
- Tag schema & file metadata indexing

---

## So what is Mydrive ?

MyDrive is a lightweight, modern file storage application designed to address key limitations found in mainstream cloud platforms. Built from scratch using technologies like Next.js, Clerk, Drizzle ORM, Neon (PostgreSQL), and ImageKit, it emphasizes backend functionality over flashy UI. MyDrive offers features such as secure user authentication, efficient file uploads, smart file organization with tags, instant file previews, and an intelligent trash system with auto-deletion logic. It‚Äôs built for users who want a clean, reliable, and transparent file management experience.
